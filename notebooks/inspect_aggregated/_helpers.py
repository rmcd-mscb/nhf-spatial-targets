"""Shared helpers for the inspect_aggregated_*.ipynb notebooks.

This module is a sibling of the notebooks (not packaged into
nhf_spatial_targets). It holds path discovery, fabric I/O, HRU
choropleth plotting, area-weighted means, time-window slicing,
representative-point lookup, catalog-units lookup, and a save-figure
helper used to populate docs/figures/inspect_aggregated/ for downstream
slide / documentation work.

Notebooks import via:

    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, str(Path.cwd()))   # if needed
    from _helpers import (
        load_project_paths, load_fabric, discover_aggregated, ...
    )

Or, since Jupyter puts the notebook's directory on sys.path, simply:

    from _helpers import load_project_paths, ...
